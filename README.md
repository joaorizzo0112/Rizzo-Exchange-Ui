A technical experimentation laboratory focused on high-precision currency conversion, integrating international standards and front-end development best practices. This project was designed to be a useful and educational tool, with a focus on the **ISO 4217** standard and a seamless, inclusive user experience.

## 🎯 Project Focus

This project was developed to solve real-world financial software engineering challenges:

* **ISO 4217 Compliance:** Rigorous implementation of official currency codes and symbols.
* **Internationalization (i18n & RTL):** Dynamic interface that adapts the layout for Right-to-Left reading systems (Arabic).
* **Interface Resilience:** Dynamic scaling algorithm for displaying high-magnitude values (trillions) without compromising the design.

## 🛠️ Technologies
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Asynchronous logic and real-time API consumption.
* **CSS3:** Custom variables and native support for direction attributes (`dir`).
* **HTML5:** Semantic and accessible structure.
* **Fetch API:** Integration with external exchange rate providers.

## 🧠 Challenges Overcome
* **The 0.99 Glitch:** Removal of native browser input behaviors to ensure a minimalist and professional aesthetic.
* **Layout Mirroring:** Automatic UI mirroring to ensure an authentic user experience across multiple languages.
